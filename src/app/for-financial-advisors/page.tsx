          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            If you advise Australian high net worth clients, you know how hard
            it is to present a coherent picture of their affairs. Client
            information lives in multiple systems and folders: SMSF reports in
            one place, discretionary trust deeds in another, company registers
            somewhere else, and personal assets often only in your notes.
          </p>

          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            <li>
              Annual reviews take longer than they should because you are
              rebuilding the big picture from fragments
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversations about strategy are harder when clients cannot see
              how everything connects
            </li>
            <li>
              Entities get missed in planning, which can lead to advice gaps

                  Annual reviews often start with rebuilding the structure in
                  your head before you can address current strategy. With
                  Klaris, the structure is already documented and visual, so you
                  focus on what has changed, what is planned, and where risks or
                  opportunities have emerged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That shortens review prep time and makes the meetings
