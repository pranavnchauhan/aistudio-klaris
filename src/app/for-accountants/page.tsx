            The problem: fragmented client wealth and hidden gaps
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            If you work with high net worth client groups in Australia, you
            already know the problem. Client structures live in too many places:
            trust deeds in shared drives, ASIC extracts in a different folder,
            SMSF details in another system, and working spreadsheets on
            individual desktops.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Every year you piece the picture back together:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            <li>
              Rebuilding structure diagrams from memory and old notes
            </li>
            <li>
              Chasing missing documents across email threads and filing
              cabinets
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying to explain a complex web of entities to clients who see
              only disconnected reports
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            This fragmentation wastes partner time, makes reviews harder than
            they need to be, and creates real succession risk if a key person
            leaves or retires.
