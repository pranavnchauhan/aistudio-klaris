            Complex structures with trusts, companies, and SMSFs can be
            difficult to understand - even for the families who own them. Klaris

            Most families manage their wealth across scattered documents
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            When your family holds assets through multiple trusts, a
            self-managed super fund, and several companies, keeping track of
            everything becomes genuinely difficult. Documents live in different
            places. Different advisers hold different pieces. Successors and
            younger family members often have little visibility into how it all
            connects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            When something significant happens - a health event, an estate
            matter, or a major financial decision - families are left scrambling
            to understand what they own and how it is structured. That confusion
            creates stress and delay at exactly the wrong moment.

            Klaris is introduced to your family through your accountant or

            holding, and key relationship shown in one place.
          </p>

            You can see who controls what, who the beneficiaries are, how
            entities connect, and where value flows. When your adviser updates
            the map at your annual review, you have a living record rather than
            a pile of documents that goes out of date the moment it is printed.

            One of the most common challenges in family wealth is that
            successors and adult children have little understanding of the
            structure they will one day steward. They know the family has trusts
            and a super fund, but they do not know how it all fits together or
            why decisions were made.

            Klaris gives families and their advisors a clearer record of the family
