        question: "What is Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris is wealth structure visualisation software built in Australia to give a single, visual source of truth for trusts, companies, SMSFs, and personal assets. It maps how entities connect, who controls what, and where value ultimately flows, so complex client structures become easy to understand.",
          "Klaris is built around the KRSP Framework - Know, Record, Structure, Protect - so key entities and relationships can be recorded, mapped, and safeguarded in a consistent way.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "Is Klaris wealth structuring or advice software?",
        answer: [
          "No. Klaris does not create structures, execute transactions, or give financial, tax, or legal advice. It is a wealth structure mapping platform that helps you and your clients see the existing arrangements clearly so you can give better, more informed advice.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "Who is Klaris designed for?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris is designed for Australian accountants, financial advisers, and clients working with high net worth or complex family groups. Firms can use Klaris inside their practice and sponsor client accounts, while clients can also request access directly during the controlled rollout.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "How is Klaris different from spreadsheets, CRMs, or document folders?",
        answer: [
          "Spreadsheets, CRMs, and folders hold pieces of information, but they do not show the whole structure in one place. Klaris acts as a wealth structure visualisation layer across your existing systems, so you can see entities, trusts, SMSFs, loans, and relationships in a single, living diagram instead of a collection of files.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Does Klaris replace our practice management, tax, or planning software?",
        answer: [
          "No. Klaris sits alongside your existing practice management, tax, and financial planning tools. You keep using those systems for compliance and implementation; Klaris gives you wealth visibility and structure diagrams that make your work and client conversations easier.",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    sectionTitle: "Klaris for accountants and advisers",
    items: [
      {
        question: "How does Klaris help accountants and advisers in practice?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris pulls together a client group's recorded entities, trusts, SMSFs, assets, loans, and linked documents into one visual wealth map. This reduces discovery time, surfaces gaps earlier, and makes strategy and risk conversations with high net worth clients clearer and more concrete.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "What types of structures can I visualise with Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "You can map Australian discretionary and unit trusts, companies, SMSFs, personal or individual holdings, assets, loans, and linked documents. The platform is built around Australian structure types, not generic global templates.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can multiple advisers and firms collaborate on the same client structures?",
        answer: [
          "Yes. Klaris supports controlled advisor collaboration. Clients can invite trusted advisors with view-only or full-access permissions, and advisor-sponsored client accounts are supported. Broader family or legal-team access should be planned during onboarding.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "How long does it typically take to get a client group set up?",
        answer: [
          "Once core documents are available, most firms can build an initial structure map for a typical high net worth family within hours, not weeks. Because Klaris acts as a wealth structure visualisation tool, you update a living model at each review instead of rebuilding the picture from scratch.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Will Klaris force us to change our advice or review process?",
        answer: [
          "No. Klaris is intentionally lightweight on process and heavy on clarity. You keep your own review cadence, advice documents, and internal workflows; Klaris gives you a clean, shared wealth structure map to anchor those conversations.",
        ],

    ],
  },
  {
    sectionTitle: "Security, privacy, and compliance",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Where is Klaris hosted and where is data stored?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris production data is provisioned in the Australian region. This supports data-residency expectations for Australian professional services firms, while specific hosting and subprocessors are described in our policies and service terms.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "How does Klaris secure sensitive financial and personal information?",
        answer: [
          "Connections to Klaris are encrypted in transit with modern TLS. Sensitive identifiers such as ABN, ACN, and bank details are encrypted before storage, and access is protected with authentication, Supabase row-level security, masked advisor views, and explicit advisor permissions.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Is Klaris aligned with the Australian Privacy Act and the APPs?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris has been designed with the Australian Privacy Principles in mind, and our Privacy Policy sets out how personal information is collected, stored, used, and deleted. We also support incident response in line with the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "Who operates Klaris legally?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris is operated by Krrisp Pty Ltd (ABN 38 609 221 570, ACN 609 221 570), an Australian company trading as Klaris AI. Your contractual relationship, governing law, and rights are described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can we export client structure data if we leave Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "Yes. You can request exports of structure data so you retain a record of entities, relationships, and key attributes for your files. Data retention and deletion are handled under our Privacy Policy and Terms, including minimum retention periods for financial records.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Does Klaris or Krrisp Pty Ltd provide financial, legal, or tax advice?",
        answer: [
          "No. Klaris is wealth visibility software only and does not provide financial, legal, or tax advice. Any decisions based on information in Klaris should be made by you and your clients in consultation with appropriately licensed or qualified professionals.",

    sectionTitle: "Your high net worth clients",
    items: [
      {
        question:
          "How do high net worth clients actually experience Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "Your high net worth clients see a clean, visual map of their wealth structures instead of a collection of reports and spreadsheets. This makes it easier for them to understand where everything sits, why they have certain entities, and what your advice is aiming to protect.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "Do high net worth clients sign up directly with Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris supports both direct client accounts and advisor-sponsored clients. During rollout, new accounts may require admin review, and firms can bring Klaris to clients as part of their service model.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "Can family members and successors use Klaris?",
        answer: [
          "The live app currently focuses on client, advisor, and admin roles. Families can use Klaris through the client account and trusted advisor access workflows; broader family-member access should be planned with Klaris during onboarding.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "What problems does Klaris solve for high net worth families?",
        answer: [
          "For families, Klaris reduces the fog around structures by replacing scattered documents with a single visual record of structures, assets, loans, and linked documents. That clarity supports more informed conversations with advisers about estate planning, handovers, and future decisions.",

    sectionTitle: "Pricing and partnerships",
    items: [
      {
        question: "How does Klaris pricing work for firms?",
        answer: [
          "Klaris pricing is confirmed during onboarding based on the rollout model, direct client subscriptions, advisor-sponsored access, and the number and complexity of client groups involved.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "Do you have special pricing for accountants and advisers?",
        answer: [
          "Yes. Klaris is built to work with accountants and financial advisers, including advisor-sponsored client access. We discuss partnership-oriented pricing, pilots, and rollout terms directly with qualified firms before production onboarding.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question:
          "What is the business case for adopting Klaris in our firm?",
        answer: [
          "Firms typically see value in hours saved on discovery and annual reviews, fewer missed entities or relationships, and more compelling conversations with high net worth clients about risk and legacy. Klaris is a wealth structure visibility layer that supports better service, clearer documentation, and a stronger perception of your firm's thoroughness.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "How do we discuss pricing and next steps?",
        answer: [
          "The best way to discuss pricing is to book a short session where we review your rollout model, client groups, and advisor/client access needs. We then confirm pricing and onboarding terms before production use.",

    sectionTitle: "Getting started",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What do you need from us to start a pilot?",
        answer: [
          "For a pilot, we usually start with a small number of representative high net worth client groups and their core documents: trust deeds, company constitutions, SMSF details, and a high-level entity list. Together we build initial wealth structure maps, applying the KRSP Framework so your team can see exactly how Klaris would sit inside your existing workflows.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "How can we see Klaris in action before committing?",
        answer: [
          "You can book a personalised demo using anonymised examples or high-level versions of your own client structures. For pilots, we help you apply the KRSP Framework across a small set of client groups so your team can evaluate clarity and review time before rollout.",
